	  	<p>I really like films. Here are 7 that really made an impact on my life.</p>
	  	<ul>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759">Star Wars</a> My father took me to see this when I was 6 and it changed my life!
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673">Inside Out</a> When I first heard about the idea for this film - the characters are emotions inside a young girl's head - I couldn't imagine how Pixar would be able to make a movie out of it. But they did! And it's a masterpiece.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077405/">Days of Heaven</a> Lethbridge Alberta never looked so good! A classic film from the 70s, entirely shot at "magic hour" as the sun goes down. Elliptical and poetic and tragic. 
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a> A lot of movies in the 90s tried to depict what "hacking" felt like, but The Matrix finally managed it - mostly by turning it into kung fu.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100150/">Miller's Crossing</a> This under-appreciated Cohen Brothers film is a love letter to classic film noir, with lots of great hats, amazing performances, and its own unique sassy language.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/">Mad Max Fury Road</a> This film is to be played at maximum volume. 
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a> I'm a little biased because I used to live in exactly the same part of Toronto, but I keep finding new things in this film every time I watch it - and I've watched it <em>a lot</em>.
